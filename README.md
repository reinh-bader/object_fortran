# object_fortran
Examples for object-related Fortran techniques

Note: 
* this is currently under development
* this is intended to be illustrative code
* therefore, it provides no complete and robust implementation of
  any concept or algorrithm, but is intended as demonstration of 
  language features and programming techniques

References:
* Please see FIXME link for the Wikipedia article that explains
  the features an techniques.

Organisation of source code:
* Folder object_based contains the sources for two container-like
  types and associated procedures that illustrate how ALLOCATABLE and
  POINTER type components can be appropriately handled.
