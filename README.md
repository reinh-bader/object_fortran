# object_fortran
Examples for object-related Fortran techniques

## Notes: 
* this is currently under development
* this is intended to be illustrative code
* it provides no complete and robust implementation of
  any concept or algorithm, but is intended as demonstration of 
  language features and programming techniques

## References:
* Please see FIXME link for the Wikipedia article that explains
  these features and techniques.

## Organisation of source code:
* Folder object_based 
  contains the sources for two container-like types and associated 
  procedures that illustrate how ALLOCATABLE and POINTER type 
  components might be appropriately handled.
* Folder object_oriented
  contains sources for illustrating how to make use of the 
  single-inheritance model in Fortran in various ways.
